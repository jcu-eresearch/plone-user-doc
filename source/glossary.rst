      infrastructure for Australian higher-education and research
      institutions.  See https://aaf.edu.au for more information.

   Tuakiri

   Shibboleth
      A technology that facilitates :term:`Single Sign On (SSO)`. Shibboleth
      is widely implemented across the world's education and research access
      federations.

   Content Management System (CMS)
      An online platform used for the management of web-based content,
      including web pages, images, files, and potentially other types of
      information.  A CMS is in essence a dynamic set of web pages, typically
      all utilising the same structure, theme or layout.  A typical CMS
      requires little technical experience writing low-level web languages
      and allows non-technical users the opportunity to build rich web portals
      and sites.

   Single Sign On (SSO)
      The process of using a common authentication mechanism across multiple
      services.  For example, using the same login and password once and being
      able to sign into several different services without entering them again.

   Zope Management Interface (ZMI)
      A set of low-level, web-based management and configuration pages used
      by technical administrators of the Plone CMS.  The ZMI can be used to
      modify the structure of pages, including underlying scripts, styles and
      formatting for the site.

   State
      The :term:`workflow` state of an object is the condition in which a content
      object is configured to be in at any given point in time.  The state of
      an object dictates which users can access the content and what level of
      access they have.  For example, **Public** content typically accessible
      by all visitors and **Private** content is restricted.

   Workflow
      A workflow is a generalised step-by-step process.  In the context of
      |project-name|, a workflow refers to the review steps a piece of content
      may be required to progress through to be approved for access by a
      wider audience.
